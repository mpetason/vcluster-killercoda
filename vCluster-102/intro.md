# Welcome to vCluster scenario


We will:
- Customize our vCluster with the vCluster.yaml
- Create a vCluster using the vCluster.yaml
- Update our vCluster after modifying values in the vCluster.yaml
- Finish up and get ready for vCluster 103


Thanks for checking this guide out. We think vCluster is pretty cool and would love to hear from you if you have any feedback.
